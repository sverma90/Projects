## Description of Project

<p>In a set (*P*), that consists of n points *(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)…(x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>)* within a 2-dimensional plane. The metric calculation for the distance between the 2 points is the euclidean distance of √((x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>)<sup>2</sup>). This project is an implementation of an algorithm for finding the closest pair of n points in *P* and returning the distance value between the *m* closest pairs of points, including their *(x, y)* coordinates.</p>
