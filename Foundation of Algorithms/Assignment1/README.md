## Description of Project

<p>In a set (*P*), that consists of n points *(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)…(x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>)* within a 2-dimensional plane. The metric calculation for the distance between the 2 points is the euclidean distance of √((x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>j</sub>)<sup>2</sup>). This project is an implementation of an algorithm for finding the closest pair of n points in *P* and returning the distance value between the *m* closest pairs of points, including their *(x, y)* coordinates.</p>


## Brief Outline of File Structure

<p>Within the directory, the file structure includes the following files:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>MergeSort.py</strong> - Contains function that merges 2 sorted list into one complete list. </li>
    <li><strong>point.py</strong> - Conatins class data for sorting points by x coordinate.</li>
    <li><strong>PointGenerator.py</strong> - </li>
    <li><strong>algo.py</strong> - Contains the main algorithm that runs merge sort.</li>
    <li><strong>main.py</strong> - Sample Main provided to run the program.</li>
    <li><strong>test.py</strong> - Sample test file to test parts of program.</li>
    <li><strong>__pycache__</strong> - Cache files of runtime (program generated).</li>
    <li><strong>README.md</strong> - Brief information about the program.</li>
</ul>
